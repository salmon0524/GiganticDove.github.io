<h2 class="section-heading">I was born in China.</h2>

<p>When I think about China, it’s so much more than just the sum of its parts for me. It’s not solely about the poetic flow of the language, nor just about the rich tapestry of its culture. It’s like... a song that's been playing in my heart, ever since I can remember.</p>

<p>Growing up, I was surrounded by tales. Stories of brave souls, tales from the Silk Road, legends of dragons and phoenixes. These weren’t just bedtime tales; they were pieces of a grand mosaic that painted a vivid picture of my homeland. They rooted me, connected me to an era gone by, yet so relevant.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">My favorite - Literature</h2>

<p>Every character, every brushstroke in the Chinese script, is akin to a dance. It transcends mere semantics and phonetics, delving into profound depths. Each character is imbued with echoes of ancient dynasties, enriched by its rhythm, its soul, its essence. This is a nuance seldom found in other languages: where a single character can possess the depth of an entire sentence, and just seven characters can vividly capture a scene, a persona, a bloom, or an emotion.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">My Chinese</h2>

<0>I have been taking HSK exam since middle school, starting from 4th level, and reached 6th (the highest) level and got 268/300 in the test.
My friends describe me: "I didn't even know you were not Chinese before you told me so."
