<h2 class="section-heading">Photographing</h2>

<p>I might not have a fancy camera, but give me my phone, and I can work some magic! Each photo I take is a little piece of my day or a story I want to share. After I snap it, I spend time tweaking and editing to get the mood just right. It's not just about taking pictures; it's about capturing memories and making them shine..</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Coding</h2>

<p>From crafting AIs and designing this website, to replicating calculators and printing those first 'Hello Worlds' â€“ each project might've taken its own time, but they all carry the same heartbeat of my passion and love for tech. It's my journey, one code line at a time!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Youtube Channel</h2>

<p>I might have a cozy little channel with just under 50 subscribers, but oh, how I love it! I whip up AP speedrun videos for those last-minute crammers who need a quick yet detailed dive into topics. And hey, ever wondered about the tales behind my code? I share those too. It's a passion project, every bit of it!</p>
