<h2 class="section-heading">Speech contest</h2>

<p>Truthfully, the speech contest held by our school didn't resonate with my style. They evaluated contestants purely on the conveyed meaning, overlooking style, fluency, pronunciation, and many other essential aspects. Despite these challenges, I reached the finals in China during my elementary school years, secured third place three times within our school, and even clinched a second-place finish once.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">Waterloo math contest</h2>

<p>Since the 8th grade, I've taken part in the Waterloo math contest annually. I've been honored with awards on two occasions. In the 10th grade, I ambitiously tackled the Euclid contest, typically reserved for 12th graders, and came within just two points of earning the 'Award with Distinction'.'</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Future</h2>

<p>I will participate more and more competitions since I just basically finished my whole academic parts!</p>
