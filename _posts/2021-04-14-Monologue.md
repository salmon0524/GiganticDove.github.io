<h2 class="section-heading">Hope you are doing well</h2>

<p>Dear Dad,</p>

<p>The house felt strangely empty the morning you left. I remember waking up late that Saturday, my mind still a bit foggy from playing League of Legends till the early hours. It was then that I stumbled upon your message, the last connection I had to you, your parting words: "Do what you want to do."</p>

<p>Dad, you left in such a rush. I often catch myself wondering, 'Where did you go?' 'Why so sudden?' Every corner of our home whispers memories of you, and the weight of your absence is sometimes too much to bear. But your words, as fleeting as they were, left a profound mark on me. They stirred a restlessness deep within, prompting a question: What is it that I truly love?</p>

<p>The days following your departure were a blur. Without a clear answer to that looming question, I turned to academics. I poured myself into my studies, burying the pain of your absence beneath piles of books and papers. I took on 8 AP courses, Dad, and I prepped for the TOEFL and SAT exams. Some days, I'd sit with my materials for over 20 hours, driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge and perhaps the hope that my achievements would fill the void you left behind.</p>

<p>The results? They were beyond my wildest expectations. My scores soared, landing me among the top percentile. I felt a fleeting moment of joy, a sense of accomplishment. But deep down, an unsettling emptiness lingered.</p>

<p>Then, something changed. I stumbled upon Artificial Intelligence. Remember how we used to play chess on quiet evenings? My first project, ChessDove, was a humble nod to those memories. The process of coding, of breathing life into numbers, tapped into a passion I never knew existed within me.</p>

<p>I dove deep into neural networks, machine learning, and algorithms. I tried to understand the intricate dance between logic and numbers. Humans lay down the groundwork â€“ the coding rules, optimization techniques, and loss functions. But from there, the AI embarks on a myriad of trials, each time refining its understanding, seeking perfection. This journey resonated with me, Dad. It mirrored my quest for purpose, my pursuit of passion.</p>

<p>Every line of code, every algorithm became a step closer to my dream: MathDove. An AI not just capable of solving mathematical problems, but truly understanding them. It's a testament to my commitment, to the potential I know I have. But more than that, it's my tribute to you.</p>

<p>I wish you could see me now, Dad. Amidst the algorithms and codes, I found a piece of myself I didn't know was missing. I found a purpose, a calling. Your abrupt departure might have left a void, but it also paved the way for my self-discovery. I only hope that wherever you are, you're proud of the person I'm becoming.</p>

<p>Until we meet again, hold onto this thought: your son is turning pain into passion, loss into learning. I'm making the most of the journey, just as you told me to.</p>

<p>With all my love,</p>
