<h2 class="section-heading">What is an AI from my point of view</h2>

<p>I think AI is a collaboration of numbers and logics. Human conjure the bases of logic by coding the rules, rewarding system, optimizer, loss function etc. and the neural network begins a lot of trials; strating from random, towards a "point"; to minimize the loss or maximize the reward. By thus, an "intellegence" with artificial interception is born.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">How did I learn?</h2>

<p>YouTube is like a treasure trove of knowledge. I learnt pytorch soley on one video called "PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning â€“ Full Course" by freeCodeCamp.org and I'm learning the basis by CS231 (provided by Stanford University).</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why are you interested?</h2>

<p>As you could see in my "About me" part, I think it's quite interesting how we can boil down the world's intricacies to mere numbers. In the realm of artificial intelligence, it's all about tweaking these numbers, making them adjust and align in a way that they start to resemble 'intelligence'. The whole process, though intricate, has its own appeal. Kind of like fitting pieces in a vast digital puzzle.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What are you going to do in the future?</h2>

<p>To craft MathDove, an AI designed to untangle any mathematical conundrum thrown its way. Envision a world where every mathematical challenge, be it simple arithmetic or complex calculus, is met with a swift, precise answer. That's the world I'm striving to create. It's not just about solving problems; it's about merging my profound respect for numbers with the power of modern technology. Every step I take is fueled by this dream, this drive to bring MathDove to life.</p>
