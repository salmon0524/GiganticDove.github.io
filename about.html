<p>I was born in the vibrant city of DaLian, China, in May 2007. Surrounded by Chinese culture, my childhood memories are vivid with Chinese landscapes and traditions. However, there's a twist: my father's Korean roots made me Korean by nationality. The first time I set foot in Korea, at age ten, was nothing short of an epiphany. While it was my homeland by blood, everything felt so novel. That experience awakened an innate curiosity in me â€” a yearning to explore and learn beyond borders.</p>
<p>My tryst with coding began in the unlikeliest of places: the world of Minecraft. As much as I enjoyed the game, I was more intrigued by the idea of creating within it. I dabbled with commands, explored redstone circuits, and was thrilled by the sheer magic of creation. It was more than a game to me; it was a canvas where I could translate my thoughts into tangible experiences.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2023, the digital realm was taken by storm with ChatGPT. While I had encountered chatbots before, this was artificial intelligence on another level. It set the gears in motion, prompting me to ponder, "Could I venture into crafting such intricate intelligence?"</p>
<p>What started as sheer intrigue morphed into a journey of relentless learning. From scripting a simple "Hello World" to constructing intricate neural networks, the joy I found in AI was unparalleled. To me, AI isn't just about codes and algorithms; it's about translating the complexities of our world into a language machines understand. The grand dream? Creating an AI with answers to the vast spectrum of human inquiries. Envision having a conversation with an entity that seamlessly melds human understanding and machine precision. That's the future I'm working towards.</p>
